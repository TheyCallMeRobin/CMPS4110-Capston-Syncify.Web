## Development

### Code Generation

Included is a system to generate services to make API requests 
to the backend.

To utilize this, once features are added on the backend/ pulled in from the master branch, you should run `npm run codegen`
before running `npm start`

This will generate the proper Services and types and no additional configuration is needed after this.
